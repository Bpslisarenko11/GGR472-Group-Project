Each of the filters has one type of location: Affordable Housing, Hospitals, and Schools. Due to the large number of schools and the many different types, they are selected independently as seven different categories.
    <br><p><b>Reset zoom</b> - Clicking this button will restore the map back to its default zoom setting.
    <br><p><b>Pop-ups</b> - Clicking on any point of the Afordable Housing, Hospitals, Subways, or Schools layer will display a pop-up over that point on the map, that contains informtation about that specific feature.
    <br><p><b>Zoom to Affordable Housing point</b> - Contained within the pop-up of any affordable housing point is a "zoom to feature" button, that when clicked, will zoom onto that point
    <br><p><b>Checkboxes</b> - Each data layer is selectable by a checkbox, which will display the layer only if it is checked. Also, the schools data layer checkboxes are contained in a dropdown, which allows for school layers to be selected by school type.
    <br><p><b>Walking Distance Isochrones</b> - Contained within the pop-up for each Affordable Housing point is a checkbox, which when selected, will turn on an isochrone around the point with three different colour gradients. The first colour represents estimated walking times between 0-10 minutes from that housing point, thesecond colour gradient represents 10-20 minute walking times, and the third colour gradient represents 20-30 minute estimated walking times.
